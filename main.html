		In the film, when Lilith lands on Pandora, it takes her back to her childhood and triggers some traumatic memories associated with the place. She is joined by a robot, Claptrap (voiced by Jack Black) who insists he can't leave her side. Though Lilith finds Atlas' teenage daughter, Tiny Tina (Ariana Greenblatt) she proves to be a tough one to pin down. But when the duo are attacked by the Altas soldiers, they are forced to team up. And soon Roland (Kevin Hart) and his mate, Krieg (Florian Munteanu) come to their rescue. Roland, a former Altas soldier is actually trying to keep Tina safe from her 'father' or rather her creator, who created her with the sole purpose of finding and accessing the vault.
